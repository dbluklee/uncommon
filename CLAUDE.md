# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized repository with no existing codebase. When creating new features or implementing solutions:

1. **Project Setup**: Check with the user for the intended technology stack and project type before creating files
2. **File Creation**: Only create files that are explicitly requested or necessary for the task at hand
3. **Code Style**: Follow the conventions of the chosen technology stack and framework

## Development Guidelines

Since this is a new project, always confirm with the user:
- The programming language and framework to use
- Package manager preferences (npm, yarn, pnpm for JavaScript projects)
- Testing framework preferences
- Build tool preferences
- Code formatting and linting standards

## Important Notes

- Do not make assumptions about the project structure or technology choices
- Ask for clarification when the project requirements are unclear
- Create only the minimal set of files needed to accomplish the requested task
